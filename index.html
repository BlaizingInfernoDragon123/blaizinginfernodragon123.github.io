 <p>Hello everyone how are you all doing? Today I am gonna disscuss about "Artificial Intelligence", which is also known
      as A.I. So, without Wasting time lets get straight into it:-</p>

      <p>
        So, As we all know  that the use of computer is growing for various purpose like

        watching Movies, Booking Tickets, Playing Games,etc. But, on the other hand it has my side effects too, by side effects I mean the 
        impacts caused by computers, Let's take an eg,Suppose if we sit in front of the computer for a longer period of time it might cause
        <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=headache+caused+by+starring+infront+of+computer&rlz=1C1CHBD_enIN939IN939&oq=headache+caused+by+starring+infront+of+computer&aqs=chrome..69i57.19212j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">headache</a> or 
        <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=eyestrain&rlz=1C1CHBD_enIN939IN939&oq=eyestrain&aqs=chrome..69i57.2803j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">
          eyestrain.</a>
          Like you all might know about Elon Musk The Founder of Tesla Company which makes A.I Based Cars And other veichles, He said That-"Although, I am Making A.I Based Applications(Cars,machines,etc.) but from inside I don't like them because 
          they have several side effects too plus, Even if A.I is being programmed to think like human brain but it still can't 
          Make decisions like a human brain".
          Elon Musk also said at a conference-"The pace of progress in artificial intelligence(I'm not referring to narrow A.I) is incredibly fast.Unless you have direct exposure to group like Deepmind,you have no idea-how fast-it is growing 
          at a pace close to experimental.The risk of something seriously dangerous is happening is in the five-year timeframe. 10 years at most"
      
        </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Thus, from here we come to a conclusion that A.I has some bad side effects too. Like for eg:- If we program A.I to save the Earth then it will follow the instructions given to it and it will start saving the Earth but the twist is 
        that-'Who is destroying the Earth?' it's 'Human', So it will think like that 'Save The Earth=Kill Humans' thus, with this thing in their mind they would destroy humans' and then live their own life giving life to plants again in the Earth. 
        In some cases A.I programs or robots(Whatever it might be) can get infected by many viruses which would infect their system and might remove some important line of code for the A.I replacing it with malicious code to destroy everything. 
        I know it sound's a bit science fictional but who knows in future it might happen as how fast many 
        <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Tech+and+other+companies+developing+AI&rlz=1C1CHBD_enIN939IN939&oq=Tech+and+other+companies+developing+AI&aqs=chrome..69i57.19310j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">
        Tech and Other Companies
        </a>
         that are developing A.I as a Competition For that many Bad Intentioned Companies might also develop the first A.I and 
        might program it with malicious codes which might try to conqueor the world.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thus as a result it might try to end the human civilisation which is way dangerous compared to present day A.I.For eg:-In many Hollywood Filmns it has already been shown. I myself, believe this fact although it seems quite science 
        fictional but who knows in the future it might come true. With God's grace I hope it doesn't happen,but the progression of the development of A.I is so fast that it might happen.But I still don't think A.I will become that much 
        powerful, even if it becomes it will still not be able to replicate human brain because scientist hasn't still figured it out that how it actually works. And, in the case of A.I it is still not able to make decisions on it's own 
        and I myself think it wont be able to do that as our human brain is way advance compared to these machines.Their are many real life examples of A.I, few of them are given below-

        Ethical concerns are one of the most critical problem areas that have emerged out of development of 
        Artificial Intelligence and related technology. Broadly, we can divide these ethical concerns 
        into two sub-problems-related to Data Management and other, the adoption of A.I. technology.
      </p>

      <p>
        <h3>
          (i)Concerns Related To Data Management-
        </h3>

        Data is the lifeline of A.I systems.These systems cannot exist without data.But the collection,storing 
        and usage of data raises serious privacy concerns. Let's understant this by a simple example,i.e,Google,which 
        uses data of its users for increasing it's revenue.One of the products offered by Google is the Android OS(Operating System).
        This operating system comes with a number of google apps pre-installed.So, guys if you all are using these apps and provided 
        permissions in some instances,then Google has the following information related to you all:

      </p>

      <div class="eg-list1">
        <ul>
          <li>
            1.<a href="#">Contact List:</a>Google knows the name and phone number of all your friends,relatives,business partners,colleagues,etc.from 
            your phone book.Also,it knows the names of the persons with whom you like to talk and with whom you do not like to talk,and 
            the best and worst time to call you.
          </li>
          <li>
            2.<a href="#">Location:</a>Google knows the location of your house, you friend's house,houses of your relatives,your school,office , 
            favourite mall,cinema house,etc. It also knows the time you spend 
            in these locations,the routes you take to reach them. With a little 
            effort it can predict if you guys own a veichle,use public 
            transportation system,car-pool or your parent's chauffeurs you.
          </li>
          <li>
          3.<a href="#">E-mail:</a>Google also knows every single mail written and received by you.It also knows about the mails that you 
          never read and the mails that you wrote but never sent.It also knows 
          about the job offers received by you,and about the job you were rejected from.
          </li>

          <li>
            4.<a href="#">Hangout:</a>Google knows every little secret shared by or with you.It also knows about all your friends,their preferences,personal life,etc.
            (which was shared in hangout chats).
          </li>

          <li>
            5.<a href="#">Photos:</a>All the images of you and your friends along with their names linked with the contact list;about important events like birthdays,marriage 
            anniversaries,birth of their children,etc.Most of the time, we accept any user agreements without even realising 
            the implications of these agreements on our privacy rights.Data related 
            to the users is stored somewhere in some large databases.This data 
            can be used for a number of purpose.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The information is collected in lieu of providing us with helpful services,but the potential risk here is very high.For eg, let's take the facial recognition system.The A.I 
          system can use this technology along with the information provided by Apps like Contact and Photos,to create an extensive surveillance network that can monitor you all 24x7.
        </p>

        <p>
          Infact if this is just a small amount of your personal data,which Google has.Think about all of the details regarding you all with Google,i.e.,your search history,internet 
          browsing habits,phone using habits,etc.Add to the data that other companies like Microsoft,Facebook,Twitter,Amazon,etc. use. Try to imagine the extent and depth of the data 
          that these companies have, and you all will have a clear understanding of the ethical concerns related to data collection.
        </p>

        <p>
          I know now you all might be thinking -<strong>'What if my data gets leaked?','What if they sell sensitive information of my personal life/info. to other third party companies?'</strong>.For 
          that let's take another example here, Many a times when we are doing online shopping in any of the sites/apps like Amazon,Flipkart,etc. in their privacy policy and terms 
          and conditions there is often written that 'We do not send any of your credit card/bank info. to third parties and do not store this infos.' but, the there is a plot twist here they actually needs to store your infos, 
          for future purchases or to withdraw the amount displayed on the payment page from your bank account,So this posses us a big ethical concern-'What if they withdraw money from my band account without my permission for 
          their financial benefits?' for this cause some banks have an OTP(One Time Password) system to prevent this kind of fraud things to happen.And, there is a economical reason here to,i.e,the customer only gives them money 
          to earn their living and they sell customer device info. to third-parties because they are getting paid for it;after all if they betray their customers then the customer will stop using them and there would be no income 
          source then they will have no money to earn a living.For this reason, they don't do this which result in their economical loss.That's why we must always focus on safety measures before using them and should never give our 
          credit card details to any app/site that we don't trust or are not familiar to us.
        </p>

        <p>
          <h3>
            (ii)Bias In The Real-World Data
          </h3>

          The problem here is that the A.I. system learns from the real-qorld data fed into it.This means that A.I systems can reinforce the biases found in A.I systems.Let's take a simple example here,a computer 
          system trained on the data for last 200 years might find that more females were involved in specific jobs or that more percentage of successful buisnesses were established by mean and conclude that specificgenders 
          are better equipped for handling certain jobs(gender bias).
        </p>

        <p>
          Understanding or even detecting such biases is not easy because many A.I. systems actas black boxes.The reason behind their decision making is not easy or in some cases,even possible to understand.Many a times,programmers 
          of A.I systems themselves cannot explain the logic behind decisions taken by A.I. systems.
        </p>

        <p>

          <h3>
            (iii)The Problem Of Inclusion
          </h3>
          A.I systems trained on the biased real-world data create problem of inclusion,i.e. the problem that some people are left out of the A.I decision-making system.Let's consider an example of the A.I. used by Amazon for 
          recruitment.This created a situation in which many eligible females were left out of consideration.This is known as the problem of inclusion.
        </p>

        <p>
          <h3>
            Problem of Facts and Their Interpretation
          </h3>
          <p>
          The root cores of the bias in AI systems come from the problem between facts and interpretation of facts. AI sys. can scan data and draw learnings, from them, but AI systems are not equipped to understand the reason 
          behind a particular conclusion or learning.    
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Microsoft developed and launched an experimental Twitter chatbot known as 'Tay'. Tay was designed to experiment with conversational understanding. While launching Tay, Microsoft claimed that the more you chat with Tay,the smarter it will get,
            learning to engage people through casual and playful conversations. In less than 24 hrs of its launch,Tay learned thousands of tweets and developed a misogynistic racial perosnality.Which is kinda surprising right?
          </p>
